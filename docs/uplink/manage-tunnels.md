# Manage customer tunnels

## Manage tunnels with kubectl

You can use all the `kubectl` commands you would expect to manage tunnels.

### List tunnels

List tunnels across all namespaces:

```bash
$ kubectl get tunnels -A

NAMESPACE     NAME     AUTHTOKENNAME   DEPLOYMENTNAME   TCP PORTS   DOMAINS
tunnels       acmeco   acmeco          acmeco           [8080]      
customer1     ssh      ssh             ssh              [50035]
```

To list the tunnels within a namespace:

```bash
$ kubectl get tunnels -n customer1
```

### Delete a tunnel

To delete a tunnel run `kubectl delete`:

```bash
kubectl delete -n tunnels \
  tunnel/acmeco 
```

This will remove all resources for the tunnel.

Do also remember to stop the customer's inlets uplink client.

### Update the ports or domains for a tunnel

You can update a tunnel and configure its TCP ports or domain names by editing the Tunnel Custom Resource:

```bash
kubectl edit -n tunnels \
  tunnel/acmeco  
```

Imagine you wanted to add port 8081, when you already had port 8080 exposed:

```diff
apiVersion: uplink.inlets.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Tunnel
metadata:
  name: acmeco
  namespace: tunnels
spec:
  licenseRef:
    name: inlets-uplink-license
    namespace: tunnels
  tcpPorts:
  - 8080
+ - 8081
```

Alternatively, if you have the tunnel saved as a YAML file, you can edit it and apply it again with `kubectl apply`.

## Check the logs of a tunnel

The logs for tunnels can be useful for troubleshooting or to see if clients are connecting successfully.

Get the logs for a tunnel deployment: 

```bash
$ kubectl logs -n tunnels deploy/acmeco -f

## Rotate the secret for a tunnel

You may want to rotate a secret for a customer if you think the secret has been leaked. To rotate a token for a tunnel you can delete the secret holding the token. The inlets uplink controller will automatically create a new secret.

We will rotate the token for the acmeco tunnel in the tunnels namespace. The default secret has the same name as the tunnel.

```bash
kubectl delete -n tunnels \
  secret/acmeco 
```

The tunnel has to be restarted to use the new token. 

```bash
kubectl rollout restart -n tunnels \
  deploy/acmeco
```

Any connected tunnels will disconnect at this point, and wonâ€™t be able to reconnect until you configure them with the updated token.

Retrieve the new token for the tunnel and save it to a file:

```bash
kubectl get -n tunnels secret/acmeco \
  -o jsonpath="{.data.token}" | base64 --decode > token.txt 
```

The contents will be saved in `token.txt`
