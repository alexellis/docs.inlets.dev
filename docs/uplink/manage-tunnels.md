# Manage customer tunnels

## Manage tunnels with kubectl

You can use all the `kubectl` commands you would expect to manage tunnels.

### List tunnels

List tunnels across all namespaces:

```bash
$ kubectl get tunnels -A

NAMESPACE   NAME     AUTHTOKENNAME   DEPLOYMENTNAME   TCP PORTS   DOMAINS
inlets      team     team            team             [8080]
tunnels     acmeco   acmeco          acmeco           [8080]      
tunnels     ssh      ssh             ssh              [50035]
```

### Delete a tunnel

To delete a tunnel run `kubectl delete`:

```bash
kubectl delete -n tunnels \
  tunnel/acmeco 
```

### Update a tunnel

To update a tunnel and change or add TCP ports you can either edit the Tunnel Custom Resource and run `kubectl apply` or use:

```bash
kubectl edit -n tunnels \
  tunnel/acmeco  
```

Alternatively, if you have the tunnel saved as a YAML file, you can edit it and apply it again with `kubectl apply`.

## Check the logs of a tunnel

The logs for tunnels can be useful for troubleshooting or to see if clients are connecting successfully.

Get the logs for a tunnel deployment: 

```bash
$ kubectl logs -n tunnels deploy/acmeco -f

## Rotate the secret for a tunnel

You may want to rotate a secret for a customer if you think the secret has been leaked. To rotate a token for a tunnel you can delete the secret holding the token. The inlets uplink controller will automatically create a new secret.

We will rotate the token for the acmeco tunnel in the tunnels namespace. The default secret has the same name as the tunnel.

```bash
kubectl delete -n tunnels secret/acmeco 
```

The tunnel has to be restarted to use the new token. 

```bash
kubectl rollout restart -n tunnels deploy/acmeco
```

Any connected tunnels will disconnect at this point, and wonâ€™t be able to reconnect until you configure them with the updated token.

Retrieve the new token for the tunnel and save it to a file:

```bash
kubectl get -n tunnels secret/acmeco \
  -o jsonpath="{.data.token}" | base64 --decode > token.txt 
```

The contents will be saved in `token.txt`
